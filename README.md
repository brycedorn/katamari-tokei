==============

###### A clock design inspired by Katamari Damacy

![Initial Design](http://i.imgur.com/9yswkCy.png)

**Features to implement:**

Basics:
- Circle with radius dependent on time
- Gif (prince) with size dependent on time
- Both of these will also have position dependent on time
- Smaller circles added to edge every minute
- Hue of background changes from light blue to orange to navy to yellow & resets
- Number of hour showin in background
- Resets at end of minute/hour

Longer term:
- Add stars/clouds/other identifiers for time of day
- Animate the prince running
- Animate ball spinning
- If doing circular implementation, animate minute circles moving around edge of screen
- Animate katamari rolling off screen at end of minute / new one rolling onto screen for new minute
