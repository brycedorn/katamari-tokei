Example web implementation of the Katatokei processing sketch.

About Processingjs
------------------
Processingjs is used to display the processing sketch in a canvas, and
has certain differences / limitations.  See
[http://processingjs.org/](http://processingjs.org/) for more info.

The most common error is to resuse variable names, by naming a variable
and a function the same thing (including built-in processing functions).

Updates
-------
Copy new `katatokei.pde` file to `static/processing/`.  Copy all images to
`static/img/` and change all of its image links to `static/img/MYNAME.png`.
